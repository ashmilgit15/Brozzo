## üîÑ Want to Replace with Your Own Images?

   // In components/GalleryGrid.jsx
   images: [
     '/assets/your-product-1a.jpg',
     '/assets/your-product-1b.jpg',
   ]
   ```

**Option 2: Remote URLs** (good for quick updates)
1. Upload images to image hosting (Cloudinary, Imgix, etc.)
2. Update URLs in components to point to your hosted images
